# CODEOWNERS assigns default reviewers/owners based on file path patterns.
# Notes:
# - The last matching rule wins (order matters).
# - Patterns support *, **, and ?, and are relative to the repository root.
# - Use GitHub usernames or org teams (teams must be in this org).
# - Multiple owners can be listed to assign any of them: @owner1 @owner2
# - To enforce code owner reviews, enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection.

# Default owners for everything in this repo:
* @catbee-technologies/catbee-admins

# Examples:
# src/**                @catbee-technologies/engineering
# src/packages/**       @catbee-technologies/pkg-maintainers
# /README.md            @catbee-technologies/documentation
# docs/**               @catbee-technologies/documentation
